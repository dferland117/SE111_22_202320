    <h2>A little about me:]</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Didier! (pronounced like DDA) I love to snowboard and to surf as I find thst it really helps to clear my mind. Lately I've been focusing on going outside more. 
    <br>
   <b>I am also really excited about studying about computers.</b> I enjoy what I am learning and most of the time walk out of class with something of value.
    <br>
    I also would love to move out west near the Rocky Mountains,  such as a city like Denver.
    </p>
