      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Didier Ferland Haroun and I was born in Montreal Canada. I moved to and grew up in Cranston Rhode Island since I moved from Montreal at a very young age. I am changing my major from Software Engineering to Computer Science. Currently I am enrolled in New England Institute of Technology, but I will be now attending Colorado University at Boulder this coming fall to pursue Computer Science. I look forward for the big move ahead of me, at the same time I am definitely super nervous. However, I am confident that everything will be okay. </p>

      <h3>My time as a Software Engineer</h3>
      <p>Prior to my time at New England Tech, I had no experience whatsoever with programming or anything software engineering related. Now attending for 3 quarters, I am confident in my ability and will use the knowledge I learned here to acquire a bachelors in computer science. New England Tech has helped fuel a passion for computers I thought I never had. I get up every day excited to learn and that is helping me do so well at school. I fell in love with coding in languages such as Python and C#. I love the freedom I have with programming and having the ability to create anything. I would love to specialize in machine learning as I progress further in my education. The journey here has been a tough one but, in the end, completely rewarding.</p>

        <p>This project open my eyes to how much fun web design can be. Had a lot of fun doing this project. This also help reinforce my ability to follow exact specifations that are requested of me. I had to be precise down to the last pixel. This was very challenging but in the end this taught me so much just from one project.</p>
